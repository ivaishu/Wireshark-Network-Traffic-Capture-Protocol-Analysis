# Wireshark-Network-Traffic-Capture-Protocol-Analysis


## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on **packet capture** and **protocol analysis** using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) on Windows.  
The goal was to capture live network traffic, identify different protocols, and analyze their behavior.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Environment
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11
- **Software**: Wireshark (latest version)
- **Additional Component**: Npcap (installed with Wireshark)
- **Command Line Tools**: `ping`, `nslookup`

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Capture live network packets using Wireshark.
2. Identify at least **3 different protocols** in the captured data.
3. Export the capture as a `.pcap` file.
4. Summarize key findings and insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Steps Performed
1. **Installed Wireshark** with Npcap for packet capturing.
2. **Selected active network interface** (Wi-Fi) and started capture.
3. **Generated traffic** by:
   - Browsing multiple websites.
   - Running `ping google.com` in Command Prompt.
   - Using `nslookup example.com` for DNS queries.
4. **Stopped the capture** after ~2 minutes.
5. **Filtered traffic** by protocol:
   - `http` â†’ View HTTP requests and responses.
   - `dns` â†’ Inspect DNS queries and replies.
   - `tcp` â†’ Observe TCP handshakes and connections.
6. **Saved capture** as `capture.pcap`.
7. **Took screenshots** of filtered protocol views.
8. **Prepared analysis report** summarizing findings.

## ðŸ“Š Protocols Identified
| Protocol | Description | Example Observation |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **HTTP** | Transfers web page data between client and server. | Observed `GET` requests to multiple domains. |
| **DNS**  | Resolves domain names to IP addresses. | DNS query for `example.com` returning IPv4 address. |
| **TCP**  | Reliable transport protocol for data transfer. | 3-way handshake between local and remote hosts. |
